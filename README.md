# Honey port Capstone #

Honey port is the nickname given to the Western Engineering Rocketry Club (WERC) Hybrid rocket set to launch in the 2026 season. What makes a hybrid rocket special is it's ability to regulate and control thrust throughout the duration of the flight. This is made capable due to the injector valve / injector system between the liquid fuel tank, and the solid fuel combustion chamber. Our team's goal for the 2024-2025 Western Mechanical Capstone is to design the injector system from scratch. Incorporating all necessary safety components, measurement components, and the main valve.

The limited budget ($800) has made the system to be as streamlined, and purely functional as possible. Off the shelf components are being coupled through our Student Researched and Designed coupler system. 

This code is to show WERC what the injector system is capable of. In the final hybrid rocket design, a single micro controller will control all computing tasks of the rocket, however we will illustrate the precision and speed of our design, so Avionics can design around our part in the final design. 

### Hybrid Rocket Goals
* Automatic control over the servo motor in response to pressure difference throughout the line
* Automatic fuel shut off in case of emergencies

### Design Day Goals
* Show the possibility of control, through manual adjustments
* Use a simulated flight path to illustrate the benefit of a hybrid rocket system
* Show to possibility of a second ignition, another hybrid rocket benefit

### Functionality to Add
* simulated flight path control
* basic logic for changes in pressure differences
* safety shutoff / safety controls
* second ignition controls
*
